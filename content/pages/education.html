                    I studied Ocean Engineering under Professor <a href="http://meche.mit.edu/people/faculty/yue%40mit.edu" target="_blank">Dick Yue</a> in the <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~vfrl/" target="_blank">Vortical Flow Research Lab</a>.
                    My thesis focused on bubbles entrained by near-surface turbulence, such as in the "white water" in a ship wake.
                    Through direct numerical simulation (DNS), I obtained fundamental insight into the turbulence near air entraining free surfaces and the size distribution of bubbles within it.
                    This helped pave the way for modeling and predicting these flows.
                    For a complete list of papers associated with this work, see my <a href="{filename}/pages/publications.md">publications page</a>.

                    In addition to research, I was a teaching assistant for Marin Hydrodynamics, Design Principles for Ocean Vehicles, and Stochastic Systems.
                    I also took classes from the <a href="https://www.whoi.edu/"  target="_blank">Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI)</a> to obtained a minor in Acoustics.

                    I earned my Bachelor of Science in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering from Webb Institute in 2019. 
                    This program taught ship design, as well as the fundamentals of engineering, especially hydrodynamics. 
                    In addition to the classroom curriculum, I did internships in the marine industry that covered construction and operation in addition to design.
                    For my thesis, I studied the effect of trim tabs and interceptors on planing craft. For more about my thesis, see <a href="{filename}/posts/undergradthesis.md">this post</a>.
