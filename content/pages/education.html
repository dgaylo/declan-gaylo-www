                    I earned my Master of Science in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering degree from MIT in 2021. 
                    Building upon my undergraduate degree, I took graduate level classes in Naval Architecture, including a focus on hydrodynamics, both theoretical and computational. 
                    My <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/139438" target="_blank">thesis</a> advanced the fundamental understanding of the size distribution of bubbles in ship wakes, 
                    and the work was published in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2021.333" target="_blank"><em>Journal of Fluid Mechanics</em></a>.

                <div class="degree-info">
                    I earned my Bachelor of Science in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering from Webb Institute in 2019. 
                    This program taught system engineering with a focus on ship design, as well as the fundamentals of engineering, especially hydrodynamics. 
                    In addition to the classroom curriculum, a winter work term provided me with exposure to a broad range of the marine industry covering construction and operation in addition to design.
                    For my thesis, I studied the effect of trim tabs and interceptors on planing craft, more information <a href="{filename}/posts/undergradthesis.md">here</a>.
