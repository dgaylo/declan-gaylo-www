                    This program taught ship design, as well as the fundamentals of engineering, especially hydrodynamics. 
                    In addition to the classroom curriculum, I did internships in the marine industry that covered construction and operation in addition to design.
                    For my thesis, I studied the effect of trim tabs and interceptors on planing craft. For more about my thesis, see <a href="{filename}/posts/undergradthesis.md">this post</a>.
