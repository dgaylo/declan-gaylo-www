                    I am currently pursuing my PhD in Hydrodynamics under Professor <a href="http://meche.mit.edu/people/faculty/yue%40mit.edu" target="_blank">Dick Yue</a> in the <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~vfrl/" target="_blank">Vortical Flow Research Lab</a>.
                    My research focuses on bubbly flows created by turbulence near the free surface, such as the "white water" in a ship wake.

                    While working on my PhD, I have been a teaching assistant for hydrodynamics and stochastics classes.

                    I earned my Master of Science in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering degree from MIT in 2021. 
                    Building upon my undergraduate degree, I took graduate classes in Naval Architecture, including a focus on hydrodynamics, both theoretical and computational. 
                    My <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/139438" target="_blank">thesis</a> advanced the fundamental understanding of the size distribution of bubbles in ship wakes,

                    I earned my Bachelor of Science in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering from Webb Institute in 2019. 
                    This program taught ship design, as well as the fundamentals of engineering, especially hydrodynamics. 
                    In addition to the classroom curriculum, I did internships in the marine industry that covered construction and operation in addition to design.
                    For my thesis, I studied the effect of trim tabs and interceptors on planing craft. For more about my thesis, see <a href="{filename}/posts/undergradthesis.md">this post</a>.
