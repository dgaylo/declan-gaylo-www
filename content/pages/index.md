My name is Declan Gaylo and Iâ€™m a naval architect working on my PhD in Hydrodynamics at MIT. 
My research focuses on understanding the complex dynamics of turbulence near the free surface, particularly how it leads to the creation and evolution of clouds of bubbles beneath the free surface, such as in the wake of a vessel.
I work on both theoretical and computational fluid dynamics, including developing new computational tools to better study complex two-phase flows.
Before coming to MIT I studied Naval Architecture & Marine Engineering at Webb Institute, where I learned of and experienced a broad range of the marine industry.
