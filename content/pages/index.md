My name is Declan Gaylo and I'm a researcher in Hydrodynamics with a passion for researching and developing technology for use on and under the sea.

I obtained a PhD from <a href="https://meche.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT</a> in 2026, where my research focused on the creation of bubbles at the surface of the ocean by turbulence.
I developed theoretical models of bubble dynamics, and the CFD tools needed to obtain detailed measurement of these dynamics in large simulations.
This included scientific coding for parallel computing on large HPC clusters.
In addition to research, I TA'd multiple graduate-level Ocean Engineering courses and obtained a minor in Acoustics.


Before MIT, I studied Naval Architecture & Marine Engineering at <a href="https://www.webb.edu/" target="_blank">Webb Institute</a>, where I gained broad experience in the marine industry.
