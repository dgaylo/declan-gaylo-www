My name is Declan Gaylo and I'm a naval architect working on my PhD in Hydrodynamics at MIT. 
My research focuses on understanding the complex dynamics of turbulence near the free surface, such as in the wake of a vessel, and how it affects the creation and evolution of bubble clouds under the surface.
I work on both theoretical and computational fluid dynamics, including developing new computational tools to better study complex bubbly flows.
Before coming to MIT, I studied Naval Architecture & Marine Engineering at Webb Institute, where I gained broad experience in the marine industry.
